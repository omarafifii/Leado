# Leado App

## Overview
This is an application I worked on during an android booster course. We were working in a team of 3 and we used gitflow to manage our work during our weekly sprints.

This is an educational app, its objective is to gamify the learning experience. After the user signs in, he is entered into the home screen where he can scroll through a list of courses. Each course consists of several lessons, only the first lesson is unlocked and when the user is finished with the first one then the second one is unlocked. The lessons are videos uploaded on youtube and then displayed in the application using the Youtube API.

The navigation bar at the bottom allows the user to navigate from the home screen to another screen (search, achievements and profile). The achievements displays the badges the user can win as well as the leaderboard inwhich the user can see his rank between other users according to the points he wins when completeing lessons. The profile shows some information about the user such as the number of lessons he has finished, the points he has taken and the badges he has won.
